# lumpR

Landscape Unit Mapping Program for R


## DESCRIPTION

This project deals with an R-package called "lumpR". The package provides functions for a semi-automated approach of the delineation and description of landscape units and partition into terrain components. It can be used for the pre-processing of semi-distributed large-scale hydrological and erosion models using catena-representation (WASA-SED, CATFLOW). It is closely connected to and uses functionalities of GRASS GIS. Additional pre-processing tools beyond the scope of the original LUMP algorithm are included.


## INSTALLATION

* command line installation:

```R
install.packages("devtools") 
library(devtools)
Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS=TRUE) #tell git_install() to ignore warnings. Otherwise, it gets stuck at each warning
install_github("tPilz/lumpR")
```

* from zip/tar:
	* download zip/tar from github: [>LINK<](https://github.com/tpilz/lumpR/releases)
	* install via R-GUI


The main branch relies on GRASS7. The migration of the packaga to GRASS8 is underway, but not fully tested: [https://github.com/tpilz/lumpR/tree/grass8]
